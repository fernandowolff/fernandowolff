# Fernando Ramos Wolff

## Hello guys!
'm a brazilian software developer, currently working for Bellosoft, a software development company. I graduated in Computer Science in 2018.

I started with games and web development at the end of 2016. Since then I've been working mostly with Asp.Net MVC/Core, Optimizely CMS, and a little with VueJS. I worked with Unity3D until 2019, when decided to leave games development behind, focusing on .Net technologies.

Nowadays I am focusing on learning Data Science, slowly leaving web development behind.

Career focus: C#, .Net, Python, AI -> Data Science.
About me: I like technologies in general, astronomy, games, rpg, motorcycles, aviation, dogs, adventure books and movies.
