# Fernando Ramos Wolff

## Hello guys!
I'm a software developer, currently working for Bellosoft, a brazilian software development company. 
I'm brazilian. Graduated in Computer Science. I started with games and web development at the end of 2016. Since then I've been working mostly with Asp.Net MVC/Core, EpiServer, and a little of VueJS. I worked with unity until 2019, when decided to leave games development behind, focusing on .Net technologies.

 <br/> :computer: &nbsp; Carrer focus: C#, ASP.Net, EPiServer, SQLServer, JavaScript.
 <br/> ðŸ’¬  &nbsp; About me: I like technologies in general, astronomy, games, rpg, :metal::skull::metal:metal:metal::skull::metal:, dogs, bicycling, adventure books and movies.
